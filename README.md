# Bionichand ESEROPortugal
Our goal is to build a arduino based instrument that can replicate the motion a user's hand in a prostetic, 3D printed, bionic hand.
The main efforto go to develop skills in data acquisition and data processing, aming in the long wrong for possible machine learning applications, and in the short run to the development of a functional prototype.
